# Summary

This ThreatConnect integration with Cofense Intelligence maps Cofense Intelligence into the ThreatConnect platform. Cofense Intelligence provides accurate and timely alerts so that you can be ready to take fast action when under attack. Cofense Intelligence Analysts and Researchers work to analyze and verify phishing threats delivering ransomware, key loggers, RATs, and other types of crimeware. This high-fidelity data is delivered in multiple forms to effectively prepare and respond to attacks.

The Cofense Intelligence integration for ThreatConnect supports the ingesting of Cofense Intelligence into ThreatConnect as Threats or Incidents, Documents, and Indicators. Associations are preserved between Threats/Incidents, Indicators and Documents. Attributes and tags are used to preserve context. These Threats/Incidents, Indicators and Documents can then be searched and integrated into a companyâ€™s existing investigations and exported to other tools for further usage.
